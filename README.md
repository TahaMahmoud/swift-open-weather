# Overview:

Daily forecast application is a simple application consisting of only one screen with a top bar containing a text field accepting the city name then when the user click search app should hit api and get daily forecast data for given city name, and cache it.

Using [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5)



# Architecture:

This app created using VIPER architecture and it is an application of Clean Architecture. The word VIPER is a backronym for View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, and Routing (And I use another component called Contrcat). Clean Architecture divides an appâ€™s logical structure into distinct layers of responsibility. This makes it easier to isolate dependencies (e.g. your database) and to test the interactions at the boundaries between layers.

- Zero Pods (I didn't use any library at this app)
- VIPER architecture
- URLSession at Network Layer
- Localization
